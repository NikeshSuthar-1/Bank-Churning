# Bank-Churning
Python project about oversampling and undersampling methods to determine bank churners using SMOTE for oversampling.
Created this project to work on my machine learning skills, learning to use pipelines and try too pull out interesting data analysis about what kind of people churn
in different categories such as: gender, income, education, martial status.
